To complete Scenario 1 and 2, I have used JAVA programming language with POM Cucumber/JUnit framework.
I also used Gherkin language to write steps for each scenario, so my tests can be as readable as possible.

To run the tests please follow the instructions bellow:

1. Go to src/test
2. java/teladoc
3. runners
4. CukesRunner
5. Run the test
